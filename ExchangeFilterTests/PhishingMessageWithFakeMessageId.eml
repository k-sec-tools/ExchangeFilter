Hi!

As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your account.
This means that I have full access to your account: At the time of hacking
your account(sample@sample.com) had this password: fnjowcyp

You can say: this is my, but old password!
Or: I can change my password at any time!

Of course! You will be right,
but the fact is that when you change the password, my malicious code every
time saved a new one!

I've been watching you for a few months now.
But the fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site
that you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other
device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera
and microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence from
e-mail and messangers.

Why your antivirus did not detect my malware?
Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours
so that your antivirus is silent.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the
screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.
With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and
contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail
correspondence and messengers that you use.

If you want to prevent this, transfer the amount of $788 to my bitcoin
address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: "Buy
Bitcoin").

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1NUFhwLSmJPnjBNyjtuFPje54UG9AH1Ruc

After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never
hear me again.
I give you 48 hours to pay.
I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see
this letter.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot
be tracked like my bitcoin address.
I do not make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video
will be immediately distributed.
Bye!
